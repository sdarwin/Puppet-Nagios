Introduction/Notes
=====================

This is a complete nagios puppet implementation that works right out of the box.   It should support Redhat based servers such as Centos, and Debian based servers such as Ubuntu.   Both the client ( nrpe ) and the server. 

I strongly encourage users to send me bug fixes or just say hi and tell me they are using this module.  

Tested on RH6 and Ubuntu 12.
Need to test on RH5 and Debian.

See the INSTALL file for installation details.

See the docs/README.orig file for more information.

Thanks,
Sam
