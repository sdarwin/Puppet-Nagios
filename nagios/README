Introduction/Notes
=====================

As of 2012/08/13 this is just a work in progress.   Don't use.

This was based on the immerda project, which was based on David Schmitt. See docs/README.orig for instructions.

The goal is to create a complete nagios puppet implementation that works right out of the box.   As of July 2012, I only see partial and broken
nagios examples, although there may actually be something somewhere.  

=======================

Example: To get a service to work, use this syntax on a target node:

nagios::service::http {test:} 

Notice in this example that it doesn't use the keyword "include".  It is just calling a resource.
