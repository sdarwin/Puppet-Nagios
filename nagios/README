Introduction/Notes
=====================

TODO:
a single install on centos6 to check nagios.conf in apache, and how it deals with empty hostgroup.
install ubuntu and centos as only nrpe to see that nagios doesn't get on there.

apache nagios.conf file on RH5 not working?
empty host group not working on nagios2.  is this a problem with nagios 3?  
host-subgroup not working on nagios2.
debian caused nagios to install. is this generally happening for nrpe?
may be an issue with apache nagios.conf not permitting hosts by default on nagios2.  try nagios3.


This is a complete nagios puppet implementation that works right out of the box.   It should support Redhat based servers such as Centos, and Debian based servers such as Ubuntu.   Both the client ( nrpe ) and the server. 

I strongly encourage users to send me bug fixes or just say hi and tell me they are using this module.  

Tested on RH6 and Ubuntu 12.
Need to test on RH5 and Debian.

See the INSTALL file for installation details.

See the docs/README.orig file for more information.

Thanks,
Sam
