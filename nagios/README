Introduction/Notes
=====================

As of 2012/08/13 this is just a work in progress.   Don't use.  Should be ready soon.

TODO:  
vhost for nagios
test of different os's
automate population of nagios IP address.  It must be manually set right now.

This was based on the immerda project, which was based on David Schmitt. See docs/README.orig for instructions.  NRPE from mstanislav.

The goal is to create a complete nagios puppet implementation that works right out of the box.   As of July 2012, I only see partial and broken
nagios examples, although who knows.

To change nagios admin password: install httpd-tools, run htpasswd htpasswd.users admin inside the files dir on the htpasswd.users file.

=======================

Example: To get a service to work, use this syntax on a target node:

nagios::service::http {test:} 

Notice in this example that it doesn't use the keyword "include".  It is just calling a resource.
